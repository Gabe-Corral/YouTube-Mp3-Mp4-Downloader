# YouTube To Mp3/Mp4

**Description:**

This is a YouTube to mp3/mp4 converter that I built in React. I built This appliaction mostly for fun and personal use. You can select a download format, enter a YouTube url, then download your files.

**Setup:**

If you want to run this locally you will have to sign up at [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/marketplace) to get the api keys. You can also vist the live site [here](https://youtube2mp3-mp4.herokuapp.com/).

```
git clone https://github.com/Gabe-Corral/YouTube-Mp3-Mp4-Downloader.git
npm install
```

Once you have entered the API keys you can now run:
```
npm start
```
